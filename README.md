# MyWebsite

This website is a basic angular project that will just act as a way to display my resume rather than anything particularly fancy.

## Unit Testing

This project is being developed using Test Driven Development. You can run all unit tests by using Karma and running `npm run test` or `ng test` or if you have the karma addon you can just click on the funny play button in any test file

## Back End

At the moment this website has no need for a back end and currently does not have one, however as a TODO item I am looking for a reason to have one so I can make this website a little more fancy

## Deployment

Currently just using github pages. First must make a build with `ng build` or `npm run build` URL : https://thaggy.github.io/
